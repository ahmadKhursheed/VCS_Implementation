        VCS Implementation Using GitHub
    </h1></div>
    <p>
        Learning Git is just as easy as doing some simple commads, knowing what you've to do.
        we'll start by first creating a folder, so that we can convert it as Git repository.
        Anything you wanna keep track off, just put it in that folder, and let the know whether you wanna include that
        perticular thing or not.
    </p>
    <b>STEP 1</b>
    <p>
        Inititate the Git repository in the folder, the command for Inititating the repository is as simple as
        <br>
        <i>git init</i>
        <br>

    </p>
    <b>STEP 2</b>
    <p>
        Creating clone of repositery form github:
        <br>
        <i>git clone URL</i>
        <br>
        <img src="./assets/Screenshot 2021-10-10 184713.png" alt="init img" width="1200" height="500">
